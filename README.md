# start-project
 Set up an environment for all the projects

 This is an easy to use project starter script. <br>

 The single call `bash make_project.sh myproj` is supposed to;
 -  create a new environment
 -  add default libraries (optional: requirements.txt)
 -  create a folder structure containing [scripts, images, data, log]
 -  customize matplotlib parameters
